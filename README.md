# Gradient-Descent-
Stochastic and Batch


Write a function for Stochastic Gradient descent where there is no argument for ephocs. Instead, you should write-in some rule that exists the loop when convergence is met. 

Also use the 'solver' arguement in Logistic Regression to observe differences in accuracy.
